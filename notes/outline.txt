I like clothing and spreadsheets. So I started keeping track of my clothes in a spreadsheet.

02 ---
This is every item of clothing I've worn since January 19th. (Mostly. I don't keep track of athletic outfits, pajamas, or underwear.)

*Circular photographs of each item of clothing I've worn, in rows. Hovering over the circle tells the item (eg, "Maroon Sweater") and the number of times it's been worn.*

03 ---
I've worn some things more than others. I'll make the clothes that I've worn more, bigger, so that you can see them more clearly.

*Hovering and layout stays the same, but images grow or shrink based on size.*

04 ---
I like clothing, but what I really like is _outfits_. Putting together a great combination is super fun.

*Some circles (maybe four?) stay on the screen, and there's a picture of me wearing that outfit. The hovering effect now just says the name of the item, without the count.*

05 ---
What outfits have I worn?

06 ---
I'll connect two images with a line to indicate that at some point, I wore them together.

*Line connects all of the four circles in a complete graph.*

07 ---
Let's look at my whole closet.

*Entire closet. Hover over nodes for eg, "Maroon Sweater: worn 37 times" and hover over edges for eg, "Maroon Sweater and Black Boots: worn together 28 times."*

08 ---
This graph gives some information about outfits, but not as much as it could.

09 ---
I've worn X and Y together once, and W and Z together fifty-three times, and they both look the same.

*Nodes for X, Y, W, and Z, and the two edges all stay colored, while the rest of the items grey out.*

10 ---
When two items have been worn together a bunch, I'll give them a thicker connection.

*Line between W and Z strengthens.*

11 ---
And for items that haven't been worn together as often, their connection will be weaker.

*Line between X and Y thins.*

12 ---
Here's the whole closet.

*Weighted edges for the whole graph. Same hovering scheme as before.*

13 ---
Some attempt at a conclusion...

*Big graphic. Checkboxes for weighting nodes, and weighting edges. Calendar where you can pick a date.*
